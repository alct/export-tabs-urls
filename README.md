# Export Tabs URLs

[Export Tabs URLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-and-titles/) is a Web browser extension that allows to list the URLs of all the open tabs (optionally include their title) and copy that list to clipboard or export it to a timestamped file.

Among the existing extensions, I could not find one that was simple enough and/or had all the features that I needed, so I developed this one. It was also an excuse to play around with WebExtensions.

Consider this add-on done (except for bugfixes). I may or may not add new features depending on the fun (or lack of it).

## Permissions

- **Access browser tabs** : required to list the tabs ;
- **Input data to the clipboard** : required to copy the list to the clipboard ;
- **Display notifications** : not required stricto sensu (as the extension could work without it) but it is used to improve the user experience by providing visual feedback about what is going on.
